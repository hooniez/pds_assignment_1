The assignment for the "Practical Data Science with Python" course at the School of Computing Technologies at RMIT University requires a data cleaning and summarizing task to be completed. The data that needs to be cleaned and processed is statistical information about car buyers, which is stored in several CSV files. The data should be loaded into memory, cleaned, and analyzed using IPython (Jupyter Notebook).

The data exploration task requires exploring the provided data by analyzing the total number of owners by gender for the top ten vehicles with the most owners, identifying and fixing errors in the Price and Power columns, and analyzing the relationship between the number of Male owners and other columns. Visualizations should be used to complete the analysis.
